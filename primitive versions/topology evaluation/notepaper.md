# To Do's: #

## In simulation part: ##

* Device selection should be made so that resulting losses can be calculated.
* Capacitor values should be specified that satisfies DC Link ripple less than 1% along with the volume calculations. 
* How to model GaN devices and calculate losses is not clear to me yet. 


## In paper part: ##

* Detailed paper reading will be done and Papers to be referred will be collected.
* Plots should be more appealing visually. 
* Plots and tables to be utilized should be specified
